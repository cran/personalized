#' @description Computes treatment effects within various subgroups to estimate subgroup treatment effects
#'
#' @param benefit.scores vector of estimated benefit scores
#' @param y The response vector
#' @param trt treatment vector with each element equal to a 0 or a 1, with 1 indicating
#'            treatment status is active.
#' @param cutpoint numeric value for patients with benefit scores above which
#' (or below which if \code{larger.outcome.better = FALSE})
#' will be recommended to be in the treatment group
#' @param larger.outcome.better boolean value of whether a larger outcome is better. Set to \code{TRUE}
#' if a larger outcome is better and set to \code{FALSE} if a smaller outcome is better. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.
#' @seealso \code{\link[personalized]{fit.subgroup}} for function which fits subgroup identification models which generate
#' benefit scores.
