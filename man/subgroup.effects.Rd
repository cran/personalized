\title{Computes treatment effects within various subgroups}
\usage{
subgroup.effects(benefit.scores, y, trt, cutpoint = 0,
  larger.outcome.better = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{benefit.scores}{vector of estimated benefit scores}

\item{y}{The response vector}

\item{trt}{treatment vector with each element equal to a 0 or a 1, with 1 indicating
treatment status is active.}

\item{cutpoint}{numeric value for patients with benefit scores above which
(or below which if \code{larger.outcome.better = FALSE})
will be recommended to be in the treatment group}

\item{larger.outcome.better}{boolean value of whether a larger outcome is better. Set to \code{TRUE}
if a larger outcome is better and set to \code{FALSE} if a smaller outcome is better. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
