\title{Check propensity score overlap}
\usage{
check.overlap(x, trt, propensity.func, type = c("histogram", "density"),
  bins = 50L)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The design matrix (not including intercept term)}

\item{trt}{treatment vector with each element equal to a 0 or a 1, with 1 indicating
treatment status is active.}

\item{propensity.func}{function that inputs the design matrix x and the treatment vector trt and outputs
the propensity score, ie Pr(trt = 1 | X = x). Function should take two arguments 1) x and 2) trt. See example below.
For a randomized controlled trial this can simply be a function that returns a constant equal to the proportion
of patients assigned to the treatment group, i.e.:
\code{propensity.func = function(x, trt) 0.5}.}

\item{type}{Type of plot to create. Options are either a histogram (\code{type = "histogram"}) for each treatment
group or a density (\code{type = "density"}) for each treatment group}

\item{bins}{integer number of bins for histograms when \code{type = "histogram"}}
}
\description{
Results in a plot to check whether the propensity score has adequate overlap between treatment groups
